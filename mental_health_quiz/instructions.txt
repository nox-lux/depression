How to Use the Mental Health Quiz

Welcome to the Mental Health Quiz! This tool is designed to help you with self-reflection on various aspects of your well-being.

How the Quiz Works:

1. Enter your name on the home screen.
2. Click "Start Quiz" to begin.
3. You will be presented with a series of questions, each randomly selected from a different category of mental wellness (like Sleep, Social, Stress, etc.).

Scoring System:

- For each question, select the radio button that best reflects your feelings.
- Your choices are assigned a point value. Better moods and healthier habits result in a positive score, while less healthy ones result in a negative score.
- The importance of the category affects the score range. For example, "Sleep" is a critical factor, so its scores range from +10 to -10. A less critical area like "Hobbies" might range from +5 to -5.
- The goal is not to get the "highest score," but to answer honestly to get a meaningful reflection.

Results Page:

- After the final question, you'll see your total score and a general assessment of your current well-being.
- A bar graph will show a breakdown of your performance in each category. For easy comparison, all scores on the graph are converted to a 0-100 scale, where a higher bar is always better.

History:

- Your results (including your name) are saved automatically.
- You can view past results on the "Health History" page. From there, you can also export your entire history to a CSV file for your personal records.
