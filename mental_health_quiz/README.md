## mental health quiz
get your mental health rated for free (i hope you're doing okay...)  
simple quiz i made using tkinter, integrated with `csv` and `mysql`.  

### usage:
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt` of course,
- run  `setup.py` and enter MySQL root password
- run `main.py`!
- enter your name and begin:
  - each question reflects a score based on its impact on your life. sleep? more weightage, while hobbies have a lesser impact on you
  - be honest, no information is transferred anywhere!
  - view your result as a super cool graph!
  - view your history
  - save your results into a `.csv` file from the **history** page if you may...

UI is ultra basic. it was made through a mix of youtube and tweaking from gemini.  
i hope you like it!
