It's been a long journey so far
I'm glad you've held yourself together
Despite every crack, every crevice, every failure...
You've managed to build yourself up, one step at a time
And I'm proud of you for that.
Now... Go look at the mirror and say:
"I'm proud of myself."
You need to hear it from yourself sometimes.
Don't you? :)
Have a good day!
