it's been a while since i coded from my heart. i am re-discovering myself.

current projects:
- `api_fun`: simple API calls that do dumb stuff.
- `life`: just some words of assurance that disappear when they've reached you.
- `mental_health_quiz`: a school project that evaluates your mental health through a series of categorized questions. integrated with **mysql**.
- `scraper`: a simple html scraping tool wrapped nicely with **curses**.
